    "text": "Human Evolutionary Ecology and Health (HEEH)\nWelcome to the HEEH group in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability.\nMy research, and the research of members of the HEEH research group, is highly interdisciplinary, sitting at the intersection of the biological and social sciences and employing diverse methodologies. People in the group (myself included) employ quantitative, qualitative, and relational approaches to studying human ecology, adaptation, and infectious disease.\nAs my work is so highly interdisciplinary, I think it’s essential to understand what interdisciplinarity means and why it is useful since it is all-too-often misunderstood. This is particularly important for students doing their graduate work in E-IPER. There is no inherent value to interdisciplinary research. The value of interdisciplinarity lies in the ability to pursue answers to important scientific questions unencumbered by the conventions of a particular discipline. An interdisciplinary approach to science means that the researcher can use whatever tools she deems best at addressing a particular scientific (or policy) question. This reality highlights the need for prioritizing asking important scientific questions as the foundation for work in my research group and then being flexible (and sometimes entrepreneurial) in adopting methods to answer these questions.\nThis “lab” is not a laboratory in the standard sense of the word. It has typically been characterized as more of a loose confederation of people working on more-or-less similar topics and employing overlapping methodologies. Work in anthropology tends to be quite independent, though specific projects may be undertaken by teams. There are two ideal forms that labs’ organization in the natural sciences tend toward. We can represent these as graphs. The first is the star-graph, where all members collaborate with a single, central actor (presumably the PI).\nThis star-graph is actually a pretty good representation of the interaction graph for many, more humanistic, cultural anthropologists, who have multiple students working on independent projects and little formal collaboration.\nThe second ideal type is a (nearly) complete graph, where all members of the graph collaborate on all projects.\nThis is more the organization of a lab that is highly mission-focused and works in a specific, wel-defined area of research.\nThe organization of an interdisciplinary anthropological research group is naturally going to be more diffuse, potentially with multiple sub-communities even within a single lab. Here is a plot of the approximate interests of the lab as of Spring 2023. I’ve run a community-detection algorithm on the network. It’s quite clear that there are two broad communities within the HEEH lab at this time: (1) the human behavioral ecology/life history/cultural evolution subgroup, and (2) the global health/disease ecology subgroup."

I expect everyone to treat everyone in the lab (preferably in life more generally) with the same way you would like to be treated.\nWe work collaboratively and support each other in our research and career development. We each have our own specific interests, backgrounds, and research projects, but we are ultimately a team. I expect lab members to be supportive and communicate directly, openly, and empathetically with one another.\nStay up-to-date on your human-subjects training. Ethical protection of human subjects is of the utmost importance, particularly when you are performing research on sensitive topics such as personal contacts, infectious disease, or reproductive decisions. Don’t get put in a position where you must delay your research or make yourself ineligible for funding because you’ve let your human-subjects certification lapse.\nTreat everyone with respect. Think particularly hard about how you engage with the many hard-working administrators and support staff at our university and beyond. Our success depends on the inputs and good-will of many people whose work all-too-often goes unappreciated and unrecognized."

    "text": "1.2 Expectations for Graduate Students\n\nTake responsibility for your research and your dissertation. Ultimately, this is your work and your advisors are there to help you accomplish your research objectives, not to do the work for you.\nExpect to work hard. A Ph.D. is a grind and you’re not going to write a good dissertation if you put in half effort.\nShow yourself! Being in the office is the best way to ensure frequent face-to-face interactions with me and with other knowledgeable people in the lab, in the department, and in the broader Stanford community.\nWork with me and any co-advisors to develop an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that helps match your professional-development needs to your professional goals.\nBe honest about your professional goals. It’s OK for them to change as you progress through your graduate program. If they change, let me know and we will discuss how to accommodate your changing goals.\nPrioritize group meetings. We are all busy, but there is generally more scheduling flexibility than people let on. It’s often a matter of priorities.\nIf there is an analytical technique or method that you need, and I teach a class on it, take that class. This is the best way to make sure that we are on the same page regarding methods and your skills. Different students will have different interests but it probably would be a good idea to become familiar with the material in my bread-and-butter classes such as Biological and Social Networks, Demography and Life History Theory, Adaptation, and Global Change and Emerging Infectious Disease.\nHelp your colleagues. Attend practice talks and other lab events. Provide feedback. Help people with their methods.\nWrite papers, but do so within the framework of a broader professional-development plan. Papers should emerge as a natural part of your progress through the Ph.D. program. Taking on lots of ancillary projects is a recipe for falling behind on the key organizing principle of your graduate work, your dissertation research.\nCommunicate your progress to me. If you are around the office, there will probably be many opportunities to do this in an informal (and frequent) manner. If you are away a lot, either because of fieldwork or living remotely, we should schedule regular meetings at an interval appropriate to the stage of your graduate career.\nIf you want me to be directly engaged in your work (as opposed to just advising), pick a topic for your research that is directly related to my current research interests and expertise. If you decide to work on a topic further away from my expertise, you should expect a more independent graduate experience. Depending on the specific circumstances, you should consider changing advisors. No hard feelings; people’s interests change as they learn more about different fields.\nUnderstand that feedback and validation are two different things. Feedback, which should always be constructive, helps us improve. Validation does not (necessarily) do this.\nAttend professional meetings and present work. If you have a poster or a presentation accepted, follow through and do a good job. Chances are, someone else didn’t get accepted because you were, so there is a social cost to flaking (remember the social contract that underlies Science).\nStay on top of the rules and expectations that apply to you by your department or program and school. These change frequently and you are the best person to know what rules apply to you.\nGive me sufficient lead time to write letters of recommendation. Typically, this is about two weeks. Make sure I have an up-to-date version of your CV and any documentation describing the position, fellowship, etc. for which you are applying.\nDon’t be shy about reminding me of deadlines that I’ve agreed to meet for you."

The great Don Kennedy wrote a prescient essay on academic authorship that helps lay out the rights and responsibilities of authors.\nShould person X be included as a co-author? The answer is “yes” if they played a significant role in more than one of the following: formulating the research question, planning the research, doing the data collection/fieldwork, analyzing the data, writing the paper, extensively editing the paper, or generally facilitating the project (e.g., through funding, providing materials or code, lab space/equipment, etc.).\nAs Kennedy noted, “[t]here is a tight coupling between authorship and responsibility.” Sharing credit for a paper entails sharing responsibility for its veracity and authenticity.\nAs with so many other things, interdisciplinarity can complicate this. If you are collaborating with someone about whose discipline you know very little, the responsibility for the work of your co-author may be different. Kennedy notes that in such a case “where the work is a collaboration between scholars from different fields who lack intimate command of one another’s areas–some explicit disclosure of that fact would seem desirable.”\nDifferent disciplines encode information differently in authorship order. We generally follow the standard practice for the biological sciences. The first author led the paper, its organization, and especially its writing. Senior author goes last in multi-authored papers. Some journals allow joint first-authorship.\nWhen your collaborative research is in the planning phase, think about how you can divide up the writing so that different people who contributed equally can be first authors on different papers."

I try to reply quickly, but when email comes at awkward times, it’s too easy for it to get buried in the inbox. Generally, I think that my email response-time distribution can be characterized by a two-component mixture. The first component has a very short waiting time. I reply immediately. The second component, I’m afraid, has a large mean and a long right tail.\nWith this fact in mind, do not be afraid to follow up on emails.\nIt’s generally a good idea to be especially discreet with emails. If you must share sensitive information, you can use the secure email functionality offered by Stanford UIT. Basically, include the work “Secure:” in your email’s subject line (and, of course, use your Stanford email account). The message will be encrypted and only readable by accounts addressed in the original email. If you forward your Stanford email to a personal Gmail account, for example, you will not be able to read an encrypted message.\nThe lab email list is: heeh-group@lists.stanford.edu."

R is state-of-the-art in statistical computing. It is what many (most?) research statisticians use in their work. It’s free. That, by itself, is almost enough. There is no complicated licensing. It fits in with open-science principles, allowing broad (and equitable) dissemination of research methodologies and results, etc. R also has remarkable online help lists, tutorials, etc.\nSocial network analysis is an important component of the research of many members of the HEEH group. R tools such as statnet and igraph provide powerful open-source solutions to visualization and analysis of networks.\nWhile R remains central to most work, we are increasingly using Julia for scientific-computing applications, particularly agent-based models. The Agents.jl library is a key tool that greatly facilitates the construction of ABMs in Julia.\nAs we pursue various projects in SciML, Julia becomes even more important, since all the development in this area (so far, at least) is based in Julia.\nI do sometimes use Mathematica, which is definitely not open-source software and is therefore at odds with that open-science principle. A Mathematica license is free to Stanford students and faculty and there is a free reader that allows others to view your work, even if they don’t have a full license to use the software."

Once again, it’s free and supports open-science principles.\nThere are certainly times in science when you need to use a spreadsheet. For example, if you’re planning a career of science in the academy, you’re probably going to need to produce a lot of budgets for grant proposals. Google sheets does not have the same auto-correct problems. LibreOffice is an excellent open alternative to the Microsoft Office suite.

    "text": "3.3 Document Preparation\nIf you write a paper that has even a single equation in it, it is probably worthwhile using LaTeX.\nIn 1984, Stanford’s own Donald Knuth introduced the concept of literate programming. The goal of literate programming was to transform the communication of code from something dictated by the computer to something more easily understood by human users. A big problem with technical manuals or methodological supplements to scientific papers is when the code does not run as described in the natural-language text. Literate programming addresses this problem by linking the creation of natural-language explanations of the code with the actual execution of that code. RMarkdown provides an excellent framework for literate programming in R.\nThis lab manual is written in Quarto, which is similar to RMarkdown. The most important difference between Quarto and RMarkdown is that Quarto is not limited to R or the RStudio IDE. With Quarto, you can produce literate-programming documents for R, Julia, or Python and you can do so using whatever text editor you prefer.\nIn general, learning markdown is a useful and highly-portable skill. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that was originally designed for generating html documents in a text editor that was easier to read and write than full-on html markup (hence the cheeky name markdown). It has since become much more broadly used. An increasing number of applications use markdown for formatting text. For example I use Obsidian for taking and organizing notes. Obsidian uses markdown to to format its notes. Github Readme files are also written in markdown. Discord, StackExchange, Reddit. Most blogging platforms have markdown plugins. Even Slack has some limited markdown capability.\nWorking in interdisciplinary teams can make your choice of document-preparation software tricky and sometimes even fraught. Markdown actually provides a useful approach to harmonizing, at least somewhat. Make sure you have pandoc installed on your computer and take some time to learn how to use it! Pandoc means that you can write your technical bits in LaTeX or RMarkdown and then convert it to the word document that you know your collaborators are going to insist on using.\n\n3.3.1 Text Editor\nYou need to have a text editor. I will not wade into the editor wars because they’re silly. I use Emacs. More people probably use Vim. I honestly don’t care what editor you use, but you need to learn to use a plain-text editor of some sort."

Remember, free software is akin to “free speech,” not “free beer.”\nUsing open-source software and publishing source code for analyses (lab github). For a model of how to do this, see the code repository for Turner et al. (2023).\nPublishing data. However, this is sometimes complicated by the nature of field research on human subjects in communities. There are ethical considerations with which we must be conform.\n\n\n4.1.2 Reproducibility\nWhen you’re doing experiments or planning analysis of data collected in the field, pre-register your analysis plan. There are several different platforms that you can use for pre-registration. I use the Open Science Framework.\nAn essential – and often under-appreciated – element of reproducibility is theory. Muthukrishna and Henrich (2019) argue that the reproducibility crisis in the behavioral sciences – and psychology in particular – arises from poor use of theory. Will Gervais summarized this state of affairs perfectly in a meme:\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Open-Access Publication\nScientific publication in open-access outlets. We have a preference for open-access journals, but when this isn’t possible, always publish preprints. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of our group, we use a variety of preprint servers including BioRXiv, PsyArXiv, SocArXiv, and OSF Preprints.\nEnsuring that your work is easily found is important both for your professional development and for the goal of making science broadly accessible. You should definitely get a Google Scholar profile as well as an ORCID account.\n\n\n4.1.4 Community Engagement\nSupport for marginalized researchers.\nEngagement with collaborating communities.\n\n\n4.1.5 Scientific Communication\nStrong SciComm game is essential.\n\n\n4.1.6 Open Educational Material\nI also believe very strongly in open educational material.\nSome examples include my open course, Life History Theory in Ten Papers, that I ran in the pandemic Spring of 2020.\nAnother example, which is very much a work-in-progress, is the material from my Adaptation class.\nIn general, I think that providing brief explainers – both written and video – of key theoretical and methodological tools is an incredibly valuable service. It’s hard to overstate how much I have learned from the generosity of scientists and other methodologists who have done this. I feel like we should all pay this service forward.\n\n\n\n\nJones, James Holland, Anne C. Pisor, Kristina G.

    "section": "5.1 Analysis in R",
    "text": "5.1 Analysis in R\nMuch of the work in our lab is done using the R statistical-programming language. While I am not big on prescription, there are definitely best practices that we should keep in mind when working in R. Many of these points apply to programming languages more generally, but, for concreteness, we will focus here on R.\n\n5.1.1 Every Figure Needs a Script\nDo not ever create a figure for a publication, presentation, or term paper without writing a script that can re-create that figure. The ability to do this is actually a very good reason to use R rather than some interactive-graphics software.\nWhen I was a graduate student, I had a figure in the draft of my dissertation. One of my committee members found a mistake in it. It took me three weeks to recreate the figure, which I had constructed interactively in Matlab. I vowed to never do that again. Now, you can cerainly write a Matlab script to construct a figure (and you should if you use Matlab). However, the workflows for generating self-contained scripts to generate figures are generally better. R is obviously better at handling data, human-readable labels for your data, and mixing different data types. It also lets you write self-contained scripts that include multiple functions (a Matlab file can contain only one function).\nYour script should do the following:\n\nRead in the data from the original file (e.g., a .csv file).\nPerform whatever manipulations and transformations are necessary for the figure.\nGenerate the figure and send it to a graphics output.\nWrite the transformed data and any additional information you generated to a file (e.g., a binary .RData file) for later checking.\n\nYou don’t submit the figure until you can clear the workspace (rm(list=ls())) and recreate the figure exactly from the script. You would be surprised, if not a little horrified, how idiosyncratic things that accumulate in your workspace can find their way into figures and fundamentally alter their character, meaning, and significance.\n\n\n5.1.2 Figures Should Be Sent to Vector-Graphics Devices\nDon’t use the Export button on the RStudio plots tab! If you’re making something publication-quality, don’t use .png either.\nThe easiest is .pdf.\n\npdf(file=\"important_scientific_plot.pdf\")\n ## plotting commands\ndev.off()\n\nThe default size for .pdf files is \\(7\\times 7\\) inches. You can accommodate a two-panel plot, for example, that retains the default aspect ratio by adding the arguments height=7, width=14 to your pdf() call.\nYou need to always remember to turn off your graphics device. Otherwise, all subsequent graphics commands will be sent to the open device and you’ll either overwrite your figure or just keep adding more pages to it. Again, this is greatly facilitated by using a script to generate all your graphics.\nMany journals still require encapsulated postscript (.eps). Including the argument onefile=FALSE ensures that each file only contains a single image (which you generally want). The default orientation for postscript files is horizontal, filling the page. You probably don’t want that, but it’s a matter of taste. I sometimes use the argument paper=\"special\" and then specify the dimensions of the figure as well (e.g., the default for .pdf so when you include the figure in your LaTeX document, you can use the same scaling, etc.).\n\npostscript(file=\"important_scientific_plot.eps\", onefile=FALSE, \n           paper=\"special\", width=7,height=7, horizontal=FALSE)\n ## plotting commands\ndev.off()\n\nNote that changing the size of your plotting device or using different devices (e.g., .pdf vs. .png) will cause things like axis labels, titles, legends, etc. look different. If you move between different file formats, you will need to make sure the plot aesthetics remain to your liking.\nThere’s a lot to be said for .svg (scalable vector graphics). Among other things, it is readable by a text editor and thus has great data-preservation qualities.\n\n\n5.1.3 Comment Extensively\nWhile you are in the throes of research, it may seem impossible that you will ever forget what you were doing when you wrote the code. You will. Indeed, you will probably be amazed at how quickly you forget what you were thinking. That constructed variable that you called my_butt, yup, you’re totally going to forget what that was, why you gave it such a cheeky name, and what it could possibly have to do with your very important and serious scientific research.\nThe best way to ensure that you don’t forget what your code does is to comment liberally. Anything following a pound/hash in an R file is a comment.\n\n## this is a comment\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Always Create a Code Book\nYou know how you forgot what your code did? It will be even worse for your data. You coded sex as a binary 1/0 (which you probably shouldn’t do), but do you remember whether females or males were coded as 0? Do you remember which of your Likert variables are reverse-coded? I recently saw a data set from a well-known longitudinal study that has about a half dozen measures of body mass. Which one should you use for your analysis? Who knows, because they’re not explained in the code book. This is not good for replicability. It’s quite clear that the data were gathered without the expectation that they would be used by generations of researchers. At the risk of seeming grandiose, you should just write a code book for your data with the expectation that someone 20 years from now will be using it (including yourself).\nAn excellent way to write a code book for small data sets is simply to write out the variable definitions about your data and then use the skip argument when you read the data using read.table(), read.csv(), or whatever the latest tidyverse tool is.\n\n\n5.1.5 Use R Projects\nIt’s probably a good idea. Organize the folders too. I don’t have strong opinions about the exact form of your R Project folder, but it’s good practice to have folders for data, figures, code, etc.\nR uses a working directory. The default can be set in the Preferences or using an initialization file (i.e., a file that is always read when R starts up). If you read in a file without specifying a path, R will search in the working directory; if there is no file matching the name you provide, you receive an error message. This naturally leads many to specifying the working directory using the command setwd().\nHowever, setting the working directory is actually not recommended. It is not a good scientific practice that favors replicability/interoperability/etc. In general, it’s better to use R Projects in the RStudio IDE. To start an R Project, either double-click on the .RProj file in the project’s directory or clicking on the R Project menu button in the upper right corner of your RStudio frame. To share the work you have done in an R Project with collaborators, students, or scientists looking to replicate your work, simply share the folder containing the .RProj file.\nWhen you quit R, you will be asked if you want to save your R session. If a session has previously been saved in your working directory, there will be a copy of the workspace in the R binary format named .RData. When R is started in a particular directory, if there is an .RData file in that directory, it will load automatically. This can lead to some surprising behavior if you don’t know that it can happen. For this reason, I don’t recommend automatically saving and loading workspaces. Best scientific practice involves constructing your workspace using broadly-interoperable data formats (e.g., .csv or other flat plain-text files) and scripts.\nWhen using R Projects, just remember to account for the file structure, e.g., in your graphics calls. Consider the simple pdf plot discussed above. If you did this in a R Project directory that contained a sub-directory called “figs,” you would need to append this to the file argument in your call to pdf():\n\npdf(file=\"figs/important_scientific_plot.pdf\")\n ## plotting commands\ndev.off()"

Data formats should be non-proprietary, unencrypted, uncompressed, in common usage by the research community, and adherent to an open, documented standard.\nDatabase data should be saved in flat, or rectangular, file formats (i.e., data that can arranged into columns and rows). Probably the best format for long-term storage, preservation, and access is .csv.\nWhenever you can save data to a text-based (or at least readable) format, you should do so. There will probably always be text editors. While Microsoft Word may seem hegemonic now, word processors come and go. Most people younger than me probably don’t remember WordPerfect, which was the dominant word processor when I was in college.\nLots of information at the Library of Congress."

    "section": "6.1 A Ph.D. Requires a Vision of the Future",
    "text": "6.1 A Ph.D. Requires a Vision of the Future\nWhat do you want to do after you graduate? Do you want to be a PI in a R1 university? Do you want to work for a government agency? A teaching-mission college? Industry? Do you want to be an entrepreneur? If you are in an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program, in what disciplinary home do you foresee yourself getting a job? Your ultimate goal helps shape decisions you make in grad school.\n\n6.1.1 Adaptive Management of Your Career\nUse the principles of adaptive management, as first articulated by Holling (1978) and Walters (1986), to help shape your career trajectory. Adaptive management proceeds through a series of steps that correspond broadly to planning, doing, monitoring, and adjusting. The specific steps include the following:\n\nSpecify an objective.\nIdentify possible management actions.\nConstruct alternative models for the different management actions.\nEvaluate the success of the chosen management action for achieving objective.\nUpdate management decisions.\nContinue measurement, evaluation, modeling alternatives.\n\nFrom the perspective of managing your graduate career, this means that you first need to determine your professional goal. Suppose your goal is to attain a faculty position at an R1 university. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the HEEH lab and associated departments, you probably need to be a bit more specific than that and consider what your most likely – or most preferred – disciplinary home will be. You might aim for a position in an anthropology or a geography department, for example. Note that even with a disciplinary goal, you will still be eligible for positions in interdisciplinary departments as well. There is an asymmetry there, so it’s always best to have a disciplinary vision.\nSecond, you specify your possible actions designed to get you to your specified goal. The anthropology/geography choice is instructive here. If your goal is to get a job in an anthropology department, you need to foreground field research, preferably with a strong component of participant-observation. If, instead, your goal is a geography department, it’s critical that you include spatial analysis in your dissertation work. For example, there might be a modeling component to your work. A classic HEEH project might involve a transmission-dynamics model in some sort of structured population. You would probably want to have one of your chapters be a spatially-explicit variant of this model. Note that your alternate possible actions help you decide about what journals you should aim for publication, what conferences you should attend, what funding sources you should seek, etc. If you are aiming for an anthropology department, you apply to the Anthropology programs at NSF (cultural, biological, archaeology, depending on the specifics of your research). If you are aiming for geography, you apply to HEGS. Of course, in reality, you often will try for a co-review, including these programs and possibly others (e.g., DRMS).\nYou might also need partners for your research. This could be communities where you want to do fieldwork, scientists or government employees in the country of your field research, other scientists who have data or code or other specialized knowledge that you need to complete your project or many other things. Figure out who they are and start arranging.\nThird, think through the specifics of the different approaches you formulate. How likely are you to get funding from a particular program? How difficult will the work be, particularly given your background and training, to do the work you need to do for a particular outcome? See Section 6.3.3 for a discussion. For example, maybe adding spatially-explicit variants of your model will be especially hard for you and you’re not really that interested. Forcing yourself to sit down and think about these issues is crucial for formulating an effective plan.\nFourth, regularly evaluate how well you are meeting your goals. Have regular meetings with your advising team and write. You don’t really know how the ideas, methods, hypotheses, models, etc. are working if you don’t actually try to write about it. It’s also a good idea to present your updates. You can – and should – do this at lab meetings. Programs like E-IPER have these milestone meetings built in to the program.\nFifth, update your decisions. Take the feedback you receive gracefully. You’re going to need to get used to it, because your critics only get harsher when you are an independent scholar. Are the elements of your plan actually moving you in the right direction? Do you need to change course because of funding, collaboration, or permission issues? Work with your advising team to update as necessary.\nSixth, keep it up! When you successfully finish your graduate program, think about changes of course. For example, I went from an anthropology department to a multidisciplinary center (actually three: The Center for AIDS and STD, The Center for Statistics in the Social Sciences, and the Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology, all at the University of Washington) because I decided to change the direction of my research from great ape ecology to human population health. It worked out OK for me.\nRemember that every decision in life entails trade-offs. There are some particularly important ones to consider as you develop your professional identity. Some important ones include: quality vs. quantity, specialization vs. generalism and, relatedly, robustness vs. (present) optimality.\n\n\n6.1.2 Plan A’\nPeople talk about the need to have a Plan-B. You need to plan for the contingency where you don’t achieve your originally-articulated objective. I agree. However, I think it’s even better to have a Plan-A and a Plan-A’ (and then a Plan-B). Have two equally-appealing possibilities that you’re working toward. This will provide a natural hedge to your training and hopefully leave you feeling better about taking an alternate path to the one that you had initially imagined.\n“But this will detract from students’ specialist training!” I hear you say. Yup. If you’re hitching your wagon to HEEH or to E-IPER or EBS more generally, you’re training to be a generalist in an age of specialists. The thing is, I suspect that this age of specialists may be coming to an end and generalists may have the upper hand in the near future. This is a gamble, no doubt, but it is a gamble that has a very large, possibly convex, upside (unlike the case of choosing a dissertation project as we see below in Section 6.3.3).\nWe know from the study of adaptation that there is a trade-off between optimality and robustness. Lauring, Frydman, and Andino (2013) coin the phrase survival of the flattest to describe how high mutation rates drive the selection of mutational robustness. This amounts to the difference between a wide, flat fitness surface (where a fairly wide range of genotypes have approximately equal fitness) and a highly peaked fitness surface, where there is a clear optimum.\nFrom life history theory, we know that generalists are favored whenever the consequences of variability have a multiplicative effect within a lifetime (Haaland, Wright, and Ratikainen 2020). This is very likely the case for individual careers. We know that shocks have multiplicative effects on lifetime earning, for example. As we seem to very clearly be in an age of rapid change, with new societal and environmental challenges, and a social and political environment that is often hostile toward universities, I think that the generalist approach to graduate education and training is highly desirable. Foxes beat hedgehogs in times of uncertainty and rapid change.\nThere are possibly parallels between the benefits of being a generalist – or, at least, working as part of an interdisciplinary team – and the benefits of diversity. In an accesible review, Katherine Phillips summarizes the instrumental benefits of diversity for problem-solving, innovation, and team performance. More diverse teams broadly out-perform more homogeneous teams, even if those homogeneous teams are uniformly excellent. Indeed, as Hong and Page (2004) note, as the pool of problem-solvers gets large, the very best problem-solvers must become similar to each other. The fitness surface is highly peaked. But, as they further note, an individual’s contribution to a problem-solving team is contextual. Different perspectives provide greater breadth of expertise so even if an individual is a less-excellent problem solver, their marginal benefit to the group, and the overall quality of the group’s problem-solving, can be greater.\nSo too with the individual problem solver. The capacity to draw on a wider range of experiences and perspectives gives you greater space for insight, even if you are not the best in your field at any one thing.\nBut if you’re going to succeed at becoming a rigorous generalist, you need to become a bit of an autodidact. This is an essential element of the VC-style of generalism I discuss in Section 6.3.1. Part of becoming an autodidact is learning to be okay with failure. Failure may slow us down, but it can ultimately improve long-term learning. You need to learn how to learn and, perhaps paradoxically, too much early success can interfere with this meta-cognition of learning. There is just as much a dilemma here within the academy as there is within business: there are many incentives to succeed early and often, but those can ultimately deflect you from long-term success.\nYour capacity to be a rigorous generalist is what will distinguish you in an environment where large language models, and other forms of AI we probably haven’t even conceived of yet, threaten to out-compete people in certain sectors of the knowledge economy. No matter how many millions of parameters specify an LLM, its output (predictions) is still regression to the mean. Now, this mean lies in a pretty extraordinarily large space, but it is a mean to which these models regress nonetheless. If you want to protect yourself from AI, think differently. Synthesize. Make surprising connections and generate unique insights. Be a poet. Be a synesthete. These are hopefully some of the skills you will learn at Stanford and in the HEEH lab.\nFight to hold on to being a generalist as long as possible, give yourself a diversity of experiences from which to draw upon. Think hard about what your objectives actually are, not just what is easily measured, and let your decisions be guided by those. Reevaluate occasionally to ensure that you’re making progress toward those goals. This is simply a re-articulation of the principles of adaptive management.\nSave when you can because down-times are certain and it gives you more flexibility to respond adaptively/take advantage of risky opportunities. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Remember that we are a social species that can achieve greatness when we solve collective-action problems. A real weakness of the American higher-education system (and Stanford in particular) is that we train (and inculcate) extreme individualists. Communities are not optimized in any way when all of their members are optimizing on some strictly-individual objective function and, perhaps ironically, individuals cannot thus reap the benefits of community. If you want those, you need to prioritize and invest in the community.\nMost graduate students go through multiple possible dissertations. I actually lost count of the number I considered and discarded (maybe three?). Sometimes things don’t work out. Field logistics can be complicated and frequently depend on factors completely out of your control. Your plan should be robust enough that you are able to bounce back from the inevitable setbacks and dissertation dead ends. Here again, you will benefit from being a generalist.\n\n\n6.1.3 Construct a Community that Cares About You\nOne of the main take-aways from Steve Stearns’s essay is that Nobody Cares About You. His point is actually not as negative as it sounds; it’s really about empowerment and the importance of student initiative: “You had better decide early on that you are in charge of your program. The degree you get is yours to create.” This is true. Your advisor probably does care about you, but they have a ridiculous number of competing concerns.\nFor many students, graduate school can be an alienating experience. It doesn’t have to be that way. The Grant Study showed that the warmth of social relationships plays a surprisingly dominant role in healthy aging.\nGo to lab meetings. Organize activities with the lab. These are people who are most likely to be able to help you intellectually, reading drafts, providing critical feedback on meeting presentations or job talks. It is actually a norm among E-IPER students, and others interested in interdisciplinary research, to attend multiple different lab’s meetings. You benefit by increasing both your bonding and your bridging social capital.\nYou also need to create a community outside of the department or lab. If you need some structure to creating this community, service organizations can be a rewarding way to find and build community. I have a working hypothesis that there is something particularly rewarding in community gardening, if you can find a way to get involved with that.\n\n\n6.1.4 Publish Regularly, But Not Too Much\nThis is straight out of Stearns. It is good – and vitally important – to publish papers. However, publishing papers is not an end to itself and can become a distraction for the other important goals of your Ph.D. like finishing your dissertation (!) and developing skills. Stearns notes that, in classic Pareto-Principle fashion, most research actually goes uncited. Bias your effort toward quality rather than quantity of output. See the related point in Section 1.2.\n\n\n6.1.5 One-Pager\nWhat you do need is to have a one-pager. Have a one-page summary of your ideas/vision. You should have an accompanying short talk (15-30 minutes). You never know when you might need this and it can be surprising how handy such a statement can be. This is obviously more substantive than the classic elevator pitch, but it retains the spirit. You want something that lays out the vision for what you do (e.g., as articulated in Section 6.1), but does not place too great a burden on your reader.\nKeep your CV updated as you do things. It’s amazing how quickly you can forget about important activities.\nHave a personal web page and keep it updated! This is how people can learn about you and there are few things more off-putting than a hopelessly-outdated web page"

    "section": "6.2 Should You Even Get a Ph.D.?",
    "text": "6.2 Should You Even Get a Ph.D.?\nChoosing to go to grad school is a decision that is fraught with uncertainty and a degree of risk. There are plenty of nightmare stories to go around about great teachers/scholars who get trapped in an exploitative cycle of perpetual adjuncting. However, a Ph.D. can also be a platform from which to launch a productive and rewarding career both within the academy and outside of it. Here are some of the issues that I think any student approaching a Ph.D., especially in anthropology, should consider:\n(1) Are you passionate about research and communication of your research? For better or worse, the rewards within the academy accrue to research and publication. Some professional schools have made substantial progress in developing teaching (and clinical) tracks for faculty that reward teaching and other applied work, but this is typically not the case in disciplines housed in colleges of arts & sciences, as anthropology typically is. You need the passion for your research question to get you through the inherent tedium of research and the many obstacles to successful publication. A commitment to research does not mean giving up on teaching or other activities (such as organizational or other applied work). The NSF career awards, for example, require applicants to coherently weave their research interests with their teaching. However, research requires a commitment and, based on my rather unscientific sample, it seems that the people who are most productive in research are the people who are really driven to answer questions and are committed to publishing not because they want the professional rewards, but because they care about communication of their results. You have to be willing to write at night when you’re exhausted after you’ve put kids to bed and your grading is done. You have to write on weekends, etc. A passion for answering questions goes beyond a fascination with ideas, a love of social theory, or a commitment to education. There is a certain obsessive quality to the top researchers – answering questions and communicating your results becomes almost a compulsion. This is what helps you deal with the inevitable (and frequent) obstacles and allows you to succeed.\n(2) Are you enrolling in a program that will pay for your Ph.D.? Given all the vagaries of the faculty job market, you do not want to go into debt doing a Ph.D. The financial details of different Ph.D. programs have become more critical than ever. Make sure you are informed! Ph.D. programs should pay their students’ tuition and a livable wage since Ph.D. students perform vital services for research universities. These services include the obvious things like teaching and doing the grunt work of research assistants but includes some less obvious, but perhaps more important, things like providing prestige to their institutions. The Ph.D. graduates of an institution are the people who go on to get prestigious jobs and write important works and garner fancy awards and societal recognition that reflect positively on their mother institution. It is difficult to over-state the importance of prestige for the functioning of the top research universities and Ph.D. students play a fundamental role in constructing this prestige. Many programs will pay for a Ph.D., but they are very competitive, as you can imagine. Big grad factories that provide little in the way of resources to their students – either financial or human capital investments – do no one any favors.\n(3) If you choose to matriculate in a Ph.D. program, take advantage of the opportunity to gain some concrete (and portable!) research skills. Anthropologists have developed some really amazing methodologies that can be applied broadly. I think that anthropologists sometimes have an inferiority complex about our methods. It never ceases to amaze me how often I hear our students say that anthropologists don’t have methods! To get a sense of the potentially far-reaching impact of methodological innovation in anthropology, check out the many students of Kim Romney and Russ Bernard as just two examples. Ethnography is a very trendy idea in industry now. Having a slightly more tangible skill in addition (e.g., survey design, statistics, GIS, the use of qualitative analysis software like Atlas.ti or NVivo, social network analysis) improves not only your academic job prospects but your ability to secure a job in an NGO or industry.\n(4) Communicate with people outside of your small disciplinary circle. The ability to communicate across disciplines increases the number of job opportunities both within the academy and without. With an anthropology Ph.D., you may expect a job in an anthropology department. However, if you are able to communicate with a wider audience and, crucially, convince people why your research is important, you might be able to land a job in a department of environmental studies or ethnic studies or women’s studies or urban studies or community health or … you get the idea. The academy of the future is far more interdisciplinary and interdisciplinarity places a premium on the ability to communicate across traditional disciplinary lines. Talk to people outside your department, write journalistic pieces for local media outlets, or even write a blog. I’m continually surprised how many people with whom I make professional connections who know me from the blog I write in about four times a year!\n(5) Are you mobile and flexible? Many people who get sucked into the vicious cycle of perpetual adjunct teaching get that way because they are tied to a specific geographic location because of partner, family, or other obligations. There are good graduate programs all over the country and there are actually jobs but many would require you to move to some place you might not have considered. This includes overseas. Sometimes you take a job that may not be your ideal if it provides you an opportunity to get the work done that then allows you to trade up. If you are constrained to remain in a very specific geographic location, I would think twice about matriculating in a Ph.D. program.\nI suspect that this is a step in the professional development process where we lose a lot of outstanding potential first-gen faculty. Mobility and flexibility are easier if you are an upper-middle-class grad who has been financially buffered by your parents and, importantly, when your social support derives from a mobile nuclear family. I think there are many ways that modern professionals resemble hunter-gatherers more than their more recent agricultural forebears and the key commonality is mobility and flexibility: emphasis on the nuclear family as the unit of production, bilateral kinship, high logistical and residential mobility, an ethos emphasizing individuality over group identity. Hunter-gatherers follow prey across a landscape while professionals follow job opportunities. People who are tied to a locality, whether for livelihood-based reasons or persistent social ties, will find this type of flexibility more difficult.\nGetting a Ph.D. can pay off, both intellectually and professionally but it takes some planning and, frankly, quite a bit of luck if you’re going to make it in the academy. What is less up to luck is the fallback. Have a fallback plan; think strategically. It won’t hurt your chances within the academy and, in fact, will probably help. There are great opportunities for anthropology Ph.D.s with excellent research and communication skills. I have former students who work for major conservation NGOs, public health organizations, and who have even started green businesses. I have friends who have gone into industry and done very well. Sapient and Olson, for example, are two companies I know that get major input from anthropologists and anthropological methodologies. Anthropological insights and, yes, methodologies are in demand if you are willing to look outside of the usual channels for employment for anthropologists.\nIt’s easy to get depressed by the academic job market (and many other job markets for that matter). However, with a little bit of planning and flexibility, getting a Ph.D. can be an excellent ticket to a rewarding career both within and outside of the academy.\n\n6.2.1 What About a Master’s Degree?\nThe decision to pursue a master’s degree before matriculating in a Ph.D. program is complicated. In general, I think that if you want to do research (see point 1 above), you should probably just do a Ph.D. program. If you decide it’s not your thing after all, you can always stop early, take the master’s degree that you get along the way to candidacy, and get on with your professional life.\nSometimes it makes sense to get a master’s degree. If you’re planning to do a Ph.D. in the UK, for example, you typically need to have a master’s degree first. The British Ph.D. is generally much faster than the US equivalent and is pure research, no coursework.\nThe biggest problem with a master’s degree – other than the fact that you don’t really need one and they can slow you down if your goal is actually to get a Ph.D. – is that you usually have to pay for them, while a Ph.D. program will pay you (see point 2 above).\nI see very little utility in getting an MPH, particularly if it is your first graduate degree. Sure, it can be an important credential if you are an M.D., but then you should get it as part of your medical fellowship (and get it paid for!). The MPH is a professional degree and it isn’t well-suited for someone interested in a research career."

    "title": "6  Life Advice for Prospective Scientists",
    "section": "6.3 On Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Programs",
    "text": "6.3 On Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Programs\nI sometimes get asked to talk to the first-year Ph.D. students in the E-IPER program about my thoughts on interdisciplinarity, a cornerstone of the E-IPER program. For example, I’ve regularly been asked to comment on how to formulate interdisciplinary research questions.\nIn general, I maintain the slightly heretical opinion that we should not pursue interdisciplinarity for interdisciplinarity’s sake. What matters – both in terms of the science and more instrumental outcomes such as getting published, getting a job, getting tenure – are questions. Yes, questions. One should ask important questions that people care about. Why are there so many species in the tropics? Where do pandemic diseases come from and how can we best control them? Does democracy and the rule of law provide the best approach to governance? How do people adapt to a changing climate?\nWhere the interdisciplinary Ph.D. program comes in is it provides students the opportunity to pursue whatever tools and approaches are required to answer the question in the best way possible. You don’t need to use a particular approach because that’s what people in your field do. Sometimes the best thing to do will be totally interdisciplinary; sometimes it will look a bit more like what someone in a disciplinary program would do. Interdisciplinarity can be thought of as a random variable: sometimes it’s big, sometimes it’s small. Most of the time, it’s probably intermediate (though this depends on the shape of the distribution). Always lead with the question.\nAnswering important questions using the best tools available is probably the best route to managing the greatest risk of an interdisciplinary degree. This risk, of course, is the difficulty in getting a job when you don’t look like what any given department had in mind when they wrote a job ad. The best way to manage this risk is simply to be excellent. If your work is strong enough, the specific discipline of your Ph.D. doesn’t really matter. Now, there are certainly some disciplines that are more xenophobic than others (anthropology and economics come immediately to mind), but if your work is really outstanding, the excuse that you don’t have the right degree for a given job gets much more tenuous.\n\n6.3.1 Interdisciplinary Like a Venture Capitalist\nAs I’ve noted, in E-IPER, everyone spends a great deal of time navel-gazing about the topic of interdisciplinarity. The standard debate is whether it is better to achieve this through training shallow-but-wide generalists or deep specialists who are good at collaboration (or at least experience incentives to collaborate). I think that there is a third path. It’s inspired by getting to know some VCs around Palo Alto. When a VC company provides financial backing to a start-up, the VC becomes either the CEO or CFO until they go public. VCs need to be quick studies and become the world expert on whatever the domain of the company is in a short amount of time. This is a different way to be a generalist. You’re more of a serial specialist who is highly adaptable and can learn fast (and, of course, you retain much of the expertise of your previous gigs). You have to be adaptable and curious and good at learning quickly. It also requires some humility. You need to put your ego aside for a bit while you learn from the people who know more than you (at least for the time-being). I think that this fact explains a lot about the difference between investment bankers (esp the classic East-Coast types), who are not generally known for their humility and VCs, who don’t have small egos, for sure, but who I find much more interesting and cool to hang out with.\n\n\n6.3.2 On Productive Stupidity\nYou’re not doing science if you already know all the answers. Honestly, I’m not at all sure what you’re doing if you already know all the answers, but it’s certainly not science. Science is based on answering questions, so you need to have questions that need answering! There is a saying broadly attributed to Einstein, though lacking any specific citation (turns out, there are a lot of these). The saying is good though: If we knew what we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?\nIf you think you know all the answers in some domain of research, you’re wrong and more than a little arrogant. An all-too-common form of such arrogance is dismissing whole approaches to research and scholarship because you consider them not rigorous or not sufficiently nuanced in their approach. Because of my meandering path through a variety of departments since I arrived at Stanford, I have seen both of these manifestations of academic arrogance from humanistic anthropologists who dismiss scientific approaches to human ecology as “deterministic” and “positivist” to physical scientists who dismiss social science despite fundamentally not even knowing what the social sciences are. We would all do well to follow the admonition of St. Augustine: “Let us, on both sides, lay aside all arrogance. Let us not, on either side, claim that we have already discovered the truth. Let us seek it together as something which is known to neither of us. For then only may we seek it, lovingly and tranquilly, if there be no bold presumption that it is already discovered and possessed.”\nI actually try to change the main focus of my research every 5-7 years to keep myself creative and working off the steep part of the productivity curve. It’s good to re-experience the beginner’s mind. This approach, naturally, has its costs and benefits.\n\n\n6.3.3 Risk-Aversion and Finishing One’s Dissertation\nA fundamental trade-off that every graduate student must face is between the ambition of a dissertation project and its feasibility. If you successfully pull off a highly ambitious dissertation, the professional rewards might be great, but there is a much greater chance of you failing spectacularly, especially if your ambition caused you to fail to adequately hedge in your preperation, per Section 6.1.2. A helpful concept for thinking about how to best manage this trade-off was suggested by Craig Loehle in what he dubbed “the Medawar Zone.” This is an nod to the great British scientist, Sir Peter Medawar, whose book, The Art of the Soluble: Creativity and Originality in Science, argued that best kind of scientific problems are those that can be solved. In his classic paper Loehle argues that “there is a general parabolic relationship between the difficulty of a problem and its likely payoff” (Loehle 1990). In Loehle’s figure 1, he defines the Medawar Zone. I have reproduced this figure of the Medawar Zone here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a net payoff curve to look like this, the benefits with increased difficulty of the problem are almost certainly concave. That is, they show diminishing marginal returns to increased difficulty. This makes sense. As you move from a trivially-easy problem to a moderately-hard one, the increase in payoff is likely going to be large. However, as you move from a moderately-hard problem to an extremely-hard problem, the increased marginal payoff is likely to be more modest. At some point, projects get so hard that the benefit plateaus or even decreases with increased difficulty. It’s harder to say what the cost curve with difficulty would be. You could make a principled argument for it being either linear or convex (i.e., increasing marginal costs with difficulty by Gadgil and Bossert (1970). Either way, there is an intermediate maximum, akin to the analysis of intermediate reproductive effort) and the best plan is to pick a problem of intermediate difficulty because that is where the scientific benefits, net of the costs, are maximized.\nSuppose that a dissertation is a risky endeavor. This is not hard for me to suppose since many people have at least one failed dissertation project. Sometimes this leads to choosing another, typically less ambitious project. Sometimes it leads to an exit from grad school, sans Ph.D. Stanford funds its Ph.D. students for effectively the entirety of their Ph.D. This is a great thing for students because nothing interferes with your ability to think and be intellectually productive than worrying about how you’re going to pay rent. The downside of this generous funding is that students do not have much time to come up with an interesting dissertation project, write grants, go to the field, collect data, and write up before their funding runs out. So, writing a dissertation is risky. There is always a chance that if you pick too hard a problem, you might not finish in time and your funding will run out. Well, it just so happens that the combination of a concave utility function and a risk of failure is pretty much the definition of a risk-averse decision-maker.\nSay there is an average degree of difficulty in a field. A student can choose to work on a topic that is more challenging than the average but there is the very real chance that such a project will fail and in order for the student to finish the Ph.D., she will have to quickly complete work on a problem that is easier than the average. Because the payoff curve with difficulty is concave, it means that the amount you lose relative to the mean if you fail is much greater than the amount you gain relative to the mean if you succeed. That is, your downside cost is much greater than your upside benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure, \\(d_0\\) and \\(d_1\\) are the high and low difficulty projects respectively. Note that \\(d_1 \\gg d_0\\). The mean difficulty is \\(\\bar{d}\\).\nA risk-averse student should be willing to pay a premium for certainty (assuming they are maximizing the expectation of their professional utility). This certainty premium is depicted in the dotted line stretching back horizontally from the vertical dashed line at \\(d=\\bar{d}\\) to the utility curve. The certain payoff the student is willing to accept vs. the uncertain mean is where this dotted line hits the utility curve. Being at this point on the utility curve (where you have paid the certainty premium) probably puts you at the lower end of the Medawar Zone envelope, but hopefully, you’re still in it.\nThe take-away from this is that you should pick a project you can do and maybe be a bit conservative. The Ph.D. isn’t a career, it’s a launching point for a career. The best dissertation, after all, is a done dissertation. While I think this is sensible advice for just about anyone working on a Ph.D., the thought of science progressing in such a conservative manner frankly gives me chills. Talk about a recipe for normal science! It seems what we need, institutionally, is a period in which conservatism is not the best option. This may just be the post-doc period. For me, my time at the University of Washington (CSSS and CSDE) was a period when I had unmitigated freedom to explore methods relevant to what I was hired to do. I learned more in two years than in – I’d rather not say how many – years of graduate school. The very prestigious post-doctoral programs such as the Miller Fellowships at Berkeley, the Society of Fellows at Harvard or Michigan, or the Science Fellows here at Stanford seem like they are specifically designed to provide the environment where the concavity of the difficulty-payoff curve is reversed (favoring gambles on more difficult projects).\nThere is, unfortunately, a folklore that has diffused to me through graduate student networks that says that anthropologists need to get a faculty position straight out of their Ph.D. or they will never succeed professionally. This is just the sort of received wisdom that makes my skin crawl and, I fear, is far too common in our field. If our hurried-through Ph.D.s can’t take the time to take risks, when can we ever expect them to do great work and solve truly difficult problems? Fortunately, this is less the case for students with more interdisciplinary training. That said, you should still remember the kernel of wisdom there: don’t rush into a faculty job until you are prepared to succeed. Furhtermore, if your Ph.D. has been highly interdisciplinary in nature, you probably shouldn’t pursue one of the post-doctoral programs designed to diversify graduates’ research portfolios! Find a post-doc where you can crank out the work that will help you move to the next level.\n\n\n\n\nGadgil, Madhav, and William H.
